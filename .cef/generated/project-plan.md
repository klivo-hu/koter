- **[high] Lead with the strongest value proposition** — Foreground "memorable experience" on the home hero.
- **[medium] Instrument analytics from day one** — Track reservation to learn what works.
- **[medium] Sequence high-complexity features** — Integrate Admin, AI Features, Authentication incrementally.
